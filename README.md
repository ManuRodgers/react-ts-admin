# react-ts-admin

This admin personal project is written with React, Dvajs(advanced version of Redux), and Umijs(the combination of react-router
and webpack) and there is no class React components at all because I used React Hooks to write each of the React components
used in this project. Clearly, everything is written by typescript because after using typescript I cannot write normal 
javascript(es6 and later) code anymore. The code written by typescript is absolute more readable, understandable and most 
importantly maintainable.

the source code for server side is on https://github.com/ManuRodgers/express-js-admin

# existing users for test 

1, username: admin; password: admin as super admin role

2, username: Tim; password: 123123 as  admin role

3, username: Manu; password: 123123 as GOAT role

3, username: Pop; password: 123123 as  GOAT role

if you are familiar with sports then you should be able to know that GOAT means the greatest of all time!!!!

Obviously, feel free to add new users with different roles to test this app.

note: username is case sensitive and please be patient for first time load this app because it is deployed on heroku free 
tier.
