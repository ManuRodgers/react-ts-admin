# react-ts-admin

This admin personal project is written with React, Dvajs(advanced version of Redux), and Umijs(the combination of react-router
and webpack) and there is no class React components at all because I used React Hooks to write each of the React components
used in this project. Clearly, everything is written by typescript because after using typescript I cannot write normal 
javascript(es6 and later) code anymore. The code written by typescript is absolute more readable, understandable and most 
importantly maintainable.

the source code for server side is on https://github.com/ManuRodgers/express-js-admin
